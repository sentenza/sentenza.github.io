> **TL;DR**: Links I collected during 2016 and still ongoing...

The following topics are still the most important ones

* Command/Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS): *each operation is either a command or a query*
* Event Sourcing (ES): recording every action done for analytics and rollback
  purpose
* BDD and Given-When-Then pattern
* Request-Response + Command(Handler) + PubSub (Observer and Event dispatcher) ([Reference](https://moquet.net/talks/symfony-live-2014/))

```scala
/* Command(Handler) */
val command = new Command("bar");
val handler = new FooCommandHandler();
handler.execute(command);
```
Commands **do not** expect a return value and are perfect for **asynchronous jobs** like:

* sending emails / SMS / PUSH notifications
* image processing
* data indexing and saving complex data

Think about commands as services accessible through a queue protocol (e.g. AMQP).
