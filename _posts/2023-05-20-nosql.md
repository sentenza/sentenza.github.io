Ah, the ever-evolving landscape of databases. As technology marches forward, we find ourselves facing a new contender: NoSQL 
databases. The world of NoSQL brings forth a plethora of options, each with its own unique characteristics and strengths, 
demanding greater responsibility from software architects right from the project's inception.

Now, let's roll up our sleeves and dive into the realm of NoSQL databases. This exploration will arm us with the knowledge 
to make informed decisions, catering to the specific needs of each project.

Gone are the days of simply selecting between different flavors of SQL. NoSQL databases offer a diverse range of models, 
each presenting its own set of advantages and considerations. It's a world where variety truly reigns supreme.

So, without further ado, let us delve into the depths of this captivating realm and examine the vast array of NoSQL databases. 
Brace yourselves, for the choices are many, and the stakes are high.

## Most common NoSQL databases

### Redis

**History:**
Redis, developed using the C programming language, was created by [Salvatore Sanfilippo][1] in 2009. Known for its exceptional speed and efficient in-memory data storage, Redis has gained popularity for various real-time applications and caching needs.

**Key Features:**
- Blazing fast in-memory database
- Disk-backed storage for persistence
- Master-slave replication with automatic failover for high availability
- Supports a wide range of data structures, from simple values to complex operations
- Provides data manipulation operations such as ZREVRANGEBYSCORE, INCR & co
- Bit and bitfield operations for implementing advanced functionalities like bloom filters
- Set operations for unions, differences, and intersections
- List operations with queue-like functionality and blocking pop capability
- Hashes for storing objects with multiple fields
- Sorted sets for high-score tables and efficient range queries
- Lua scripting capabilities for custom logic
- Transaction support for atomic operations
- Pub/Sub functionality for messaging
- GEO API for radius-based queries

**Best suited for:**
Redis is ideal for scenarios involving rapidly changing data that can fit mostly in memory. It excels in real-time stock prices, analytics, leaderboards, real-time communication, and can be used as a replacement for memcached.

For more information, you can refer to the [official Redis documentation][2].

### Cassandra

**History:**
Cassandra, developed using the Java programming language, was initially created by Facebook and open-sourced in 2008. It was designed to handle massive datasets and provide high scalability, fault tolerance, and easy distribution of data.

**Key Features:**
- Store huge datasets in an "almost" SQL-like environment
- Querying by key or key range, with secondary indices available
- Tunable trade-offs for distribution and replication (N, R, W)
- Data expiration capability for efficient data management
- Optimized for fast writes, especially in disk-bound scenarios
- Integration with Apache Hadoop for map/reduce capabilities
- Reliable cross-datacenter replication for data redundancy
- Distributed counter datatype for efficient counting
- Customization through Java-triggered operations

**Best suited for:**
Cassandra is well-suited for scenarios that involve storing massive datasets that cannot fit on a single server. It excels in web analytics, transaction logging, data collection from extensive sensor arrays, and provides a familiar SQL-like interface for easy data management.

For more information, you can refer to the [official Cassandra documentation][3].

### DynamoDB

**History:**
DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by [Amazon Web Services (AWS)][4]. It was designed to deliver 
fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB was first announced in 2012 and has since become a 
popular choice for various applications.

**Key Features:**
- Fully managed NoSQL database service
- Automatic scaling to handle varying workloads
- Built-in data replication and high availability
- Flexible schema with support for key-value and document data models
- Fast, single-digit millisecond latency for read and write operations
- Support for ACID transactions and atomic operations
- Powerful querying with secondary indexes and rich filtering capabilities
- Global tables for multi-region replication and global data access
- Data encryption at rest and in transit for enhanced security
- Integration with other AWS services for seamless development and deployment

**Best suited for:**
DynamoDB is well-suited for a wide range of applications, including e-commerce, gaming, ad tech, social media, and more. 
It is particularly beneficial for use cases that require low-latency, scalable, and highly available data storage.

For more information, you can refer to the [official DynamoDB documentation][5] provided by AWS.
