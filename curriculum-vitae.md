</div>

I'm a software engineer constantly keen on improving my skills and open-minded about cutting edge technologies.

I have a strong background as software developer and broader engineering knowledge provided by my studies, making me technically flexible and capable to focus on any given task. 
I'm highly motivated to develop a better awareness of software methodologies and best practices in commercial environments with large teams.<br>
Not only am I happy working in a team, but also I feel comfortable in working remotely. For details about my skills please refer to my working experiences and to my <i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i> [ profile page](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/alfredotorre/en).

In my spare time I love reading Sci-Fi books or developing new projects that almost always involves principles of functional programming.

#### An inspiring quote

> *"[...] E quanto importi nella vita, non già di esser forti, ma di sentirsi forti, di essersi misurati almeno una volta, di essersi trovati almeno una volta nella condizione umana più antica, soli davanti alla pietra cieca e sorda, senza altri aiuti che le proprie mani e la propria testa…"* (IT)

>  *"[...] I also know how important it is in life not necessarily to be strong but to feel strong. To measure yourself at least once. To find yourself at least once in the most ancient of human conditions. Facing the blind deaf stone alone, with nothing to help you but your hands and your own head…"* (EN)
